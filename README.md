# Rendering an Element into the DOM

In this project, I have simulated element rendering similar to front-end libraries, and ultimately bundled the project using Webpack. The project incorporates the following technologies and concepts:

- **Element rendering**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Advanced TypeScript : Generics, Decorators**
- **Sass**
- **Drag & Drop functionality**
- **Webpack Config**
